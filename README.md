# Front-end Coding Challenge

This repository is my implementation to solve the [United Remote front-end coding challenge](https://github.com/hiddenfounders/frontend-coding-challenge).

[View Demo](https://malyanaskyrim.github.io/list-git-repos-challenge/)

## Used technologies

- **Reactjs** as the main javascript library.
- **npm** as my dependencies manager.
- **git** for version control.
- **react-infinite-scroller** to load more results on page scroll.
